#can use binary representation of numbers

#Write a function:
#`get_random_subset_of_naturals_up_to_20()`
#that:
#outputs a random subset of the set of integers between $1$ and $20$ in the format of a `numpy` array.
#The draw of the subset should be uniform, i.e., any subset should in principle have the same chance to be outputted by your function. This problem will be graded manually.
#For $2$ out of the $5$ points allotted to this problem, you can write your function however you wish. To get $5$ points, your function is allowed to make a single call to the `numpy.random.randint()` method
#but it cannot make use of any other random methods.
